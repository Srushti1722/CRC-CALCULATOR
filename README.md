# 🚀 CRC Calculator Web App  

🔍 **Ever wondered how errors in digital communication are detected?**  
💡 The **CRC Calculator** is here to **unravel the mystery** behind **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**—a **powerful algorithm** used in networking, storage, and data transmission to **ensure data integrity**.  

## 🏆 Why This Project?  
In a world driven by **data exchange**, errors happen—whether due to **network glitches**, **hardware faults**, or **interference**. The CRC algorithm acts as a **watchdog**, detecting errors **before they cause problems**.  

This web app lets you **experiment with CRC calculations** in a simple, intuitive interface. Just **input your binary data and generator polynomial**, and let the magic happen! 🎩✨  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Web-based Interface** – No need for complex software, just a browser!  
✅ **Real-time CRC Calculation** – Enter data, hit calculate, and get instant results!  
✅ **Error Detection Simulation** – See how CRC helps detect data corruption.  
✅ **User-friendly & Interactive** – Simple, sleek UI with real-time validation.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🔹 **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
🔹 **Backend**: Python, Flask  
🔹 **Styling**: CSS for a clean & modern look  

## 🏗️ How It Works  
🔢 **Step 1**: Enter binary data (e.g., `1101011011`)  
🔬 **Step 2**: Provide a generator polynomial (e.g., `1011`)  
⚙️ **Step 3**: The app runs a modulo-2 division and computes the CRC checksum  
📊 **Step 4**: The output displays the **CRC checksum** and the **transmitted frame**  
🔍 **Step 5**: Use CRC to verify if received data is error-free!  

## 🚀 Quick Start  

### 1️⃣ Install & Run Locally  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crc-calculator.git
cd crc-calculator
pip install flask
